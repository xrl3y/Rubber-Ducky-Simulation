# Rubber-Ducky-Simulation
In this project, we simulate a Rubber Ducky using a standard USB drive with a Python script and autorun functionality. This allows us to replicate its keystroke execution capabilities for automated penetration testing. The project emphasizes scripting skills and highlights the security risks of USB devices in cybersecurity.
